# Molecular-Analysis-of-variance-in-R
"Molecular analysis of variance" (MAV) is a statistical method used to partition genetic variation among different levels of organization. It is similar to the traditional analysis of variance (ANOVA) but is applied to genetic data, particularly when analyzing molecular markers such as SNPs (Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms) or microsatellites.
